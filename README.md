# BCILDCMCONVERT

Converts DICOM to NIFTI, organizes the data into a study directory, and reads MRI scanning params useful for preprocessing brain imaging with HCP pipeline and FSL.

### Installation and Usage
1. System requirements: linux, python3, nibabel 3.1.0, nampy 1.16.4 pydicom 2.0.0, dcm2niix
2. Download BCILDCMCONVERT.zip and unzip
3. Run bcil_dcm_convert.py in the terminal

``` 
 usage:
 
 ex). $ bcil_dcm_convert.py [option(s)] <Study dir> <Subject DICOM dir>
 
 Compulsory arguments:
     <Study dir>           : full path to Study dir (parent dir) in which a new subject directory will be saved
     <Subject DICOM dir>   : full path to Subject dir including DICOM files 
 
 Optional arguments:
     -s  <Subject dirname> : subject dirname to be created in Study dir (by default, the dirname is automatically created)
     -o                    : overwrite Studyinfo.csv, Seriesinfo.csv, DICOMlist and NIFTI in <Subject dir>
```

Example outputs are \<subject dir\> of which structure is as follows:

```
<Study dir>/<Subject dir>  
 `--RawData  
    |-- DICOMlist.txt   
    |-- NIFTI  
    |-- Seriesinfo.csv  
    `-- Studyinfo.csv  
```

- DICOMlist: a text listing input DICOM directories, which may be useful to track the original DICOM data.  
- NIFTI: sub-directory including all the NIFTI volumes converted from DICOM in the input \<Subject DICOM dir\>.  
- Seriesinfo.csv: major scanning parameters of each sequnce series. It includes dwell time in read and phase and their directions (in subject's coordinates), which are needed to correct distortion of images.  
- Studyinfo.csv: information on study, patients, and MRI scanners. It also inludes a type of gradient coil, which is needed when applying non-linear gradient distortion.  
  
Detailes and examples of Seriesinfo.csv, Studyinfo.csv and NIFTI directory are desribed at [wiki][]
